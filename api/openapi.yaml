        This API confirms a booking when the prebook Id and the rate Id from the pre book stage along with the guest and payment information are passed.

        The guest information is an object that should include the guest first name, last name and email.

        The payment information is an object that should include the name, credit card number, expiry and CVC number.

        The response will confirm the booking along with a booking Id and a hotel confirmation code. It will also include the booking details including the dates, price and the cancellation policies.
